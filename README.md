# HR Reporting SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Employee Details Analysis 
**Database**:`SQL DB`
**Tech Used**: `SQL Server` `ETL Pipeline`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze employee data. The project involves setting up a employee database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a database**: Populate a database with the provided employee data data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Set up**: The project starts by setting up on an existing database created with this code
  ``` CREATE DATABASE [SQL_DB]; ```
- **Table Creation**: The tables, ```[Employee Info]``` and ```[Employee position2]``` were imported via ETL pipeline.


### 2. Data Cleaning

- **Null Value Check**: View tables and check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
- **Datatype Check**: View tables and check datatype and alter columns with wrong datatypes.

```sql
USE [SQL DB]
GO

SELECT [EmpID]
      ,[EmpFname]
      ,[EmpLname]
      ,[Department]
      ,[Project]
      ,[Address]
      ,[DOB]
      ,[Gender]
  FROM [dbo].['Employee Info$']

GO


DELETE FROM [dbo].['Employee Info$']
WHERE GENDER IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE [dbo].['Employee Info$']
alter column DOB DATE;
```

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

-- Q1: Write a query to fetch the EmpFname from the EmployeeInfo table in the upper case and use the ALIAS name as EmpName.
```sql
SELECT UPPER(EmpFname) AS [EmpName]
FROM [Employee Info];
```
-- Q2: Write a query to fetch the number of employees working in the department ‘HR’.
```sql
SELECT COUNT (*) AS [Employee Count]
from [dbo].[Employee Info]
WHERE [Department] = 'HR';
```
-- Q3: Write a query to get the current date.
```sql
SELECT cast( GETDATE() AS date) AS [Current Date];
```
-- Q4: Write a query to retrieve the first four characters of  EmpLname from the EmployeeInfo table.
```sql
SELECT LEFT (EmpLname, 4) AS FirstFourChars
FROM [Employee Info];
```
-- Q5: Write a query to fetch only the place name(string before brackets) from the Address column of EmployeeInfo table.
```sql
SELECT  LEFT(Address, CHARINDEX('(', Address) -1) AS [Place Name]
FROM [Employee Info];
```
-- Q6: Write a query to create a new table that consists of data and structure copied from the other table.
```sql
SELECT *
INTO [Newtable]
from [dbo].[Employee Info];
```
-- This created a new table joining both tables into it using join via emplyee ID
```sql
SELECT ei.[EmpID], EI.[EmpFname],EI.[EmpLname],EI.[Department],
EI.[Project],EI.[DOB],
EP.[EmpPosition],EP.[DateOfJoining],EP.[Salary]
INTO [New Emplyee Table]
FROM [Employee Info] ei
JOIN [dbo].[Employee position2] ep ON ei.[EmpID] = ep.[EmpID];
```
-- Q7: Write q query to find all the employees whose salary is between 50000 to 100000.
```sql
SELECT EP.[EmpID],
EI.[EmpFname] + ' ' + EI.[EmpLname] AS FULLNAME
FROM [dbo].[Employee position2] EP
JOIN [dbo].[Employee Info] EI ON EP.[EmpID] = EI.[EmpID]
WHERE EP.[Salary] BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000;
```
-- Q8: Write a query to find the names of employees that begin with ‘S’
```sql
SELECT [EmpFname]
FROM [dbo].[Employee Info]
WHERE [EmpFname] LIKE 'S%';
```
-- Q9: Write a query to fetch top N records.
```sql
-- TOP 5
SELECT TOP (5) *
FROM [dbo].[Employee position2]
ORDER BY [Salary] DESC;

--TOP 10
SELECT TOP 10 PERCENT *
FROM [dbo].[Employee position2]
ORDER BY [Salary] DESC;
```
-- Q10: Write a query to retrieve the EmpFname and EmpLname in a single column as “FullName”. The first name and the last name must be separated with space.
```sql
SELECT [EmpFname] + ' ' + [EmpLname] AS FULLNAME
FROM [dbo].[Employee Info];
```
-- Q11: Write a query find number of employees whose DOB is between 02/05/1970 to 31/12/1995 and are grouped according to gender
```sql
SELECT COUNT ([EmpID])
FROM [dbo].[Employee Info]
WHERE [DOB] BETWEEN '1970/05/02' AND '1995/12/31';
```
-- Q12: Write a query to fetch all the records from the EmployeeInfo table ordered by EmpLname in descending order and Department in the ascending order.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[Employee Info]
ORDER BY [EmpLname];
```
-- Q13: Write a query to fetch details of employees whose EmpLname ends with an alphabet ‘A’ and contains five alphabets.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[Employee Info]
WHERE [EmpLname] LIKE '%A'
AND LEN([EmpLname])= 5;
```
-- Q14: Write a query to fetch details of all employees excluding the employees with first names, “Sanjay” and “Sonia” from the EmployeeInfo table.
```sql
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employee Info]
WHERE [EmpFname] NOT IN ('Sanjay', 'Sonia')


SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employee Info]
WHERE [EmpFname] != 'Sanjay' AND [EmpFname] != 'Sonia'
```
-- Q15: Write a query to fetch details of employees with the address as “DELHI(DEL)”
```sql
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employee Info]
WHERE [Address] = 'DELHI(DEL)';
```
-- Q16: Write a query to fetch all employees who also hold the managerial position.
```sql
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employee position2]
WHERE [EmpPosition] = 'Manager';

--This query used the Join function

SELECT 
ei.[EmpFname] + ' ' + ei.[EmpLname] AS FULLNAME, ep.*
FROM [dbo].[Employee position2] ep
JOIN [dbo].[Employee Info] EI ON EP.[EmpID] = EI.[EmpID]
WHERE [EmpPosition] = 'Manager';
```
-- Q17: Write a query to fetch the department-wise count of employees sorted by department’s count in ascending order
```sql
SELECT [Department],COUNT([EmpID]) AS EmployeeCount
from [dbo].[Employee Info]
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY EmployeeCount ASC;
```
-- Q18: Write a query to fecth Male employees in HR department
```sql
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employee Info]
WHERE [Gender] = 'M' AND [Department] = 'HR';
```
-- Q19: Write a SQL query to retrieve employee details from EmployeeInfo table who have a date of joining in the EmployeePosition table
```sql
-- Option 1

SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employee Info] EI
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM [dbo].[Employee position2] EP
    WHERE EP.EmpID = EI.EmpID
      AND EP.DateOfJoining IS NOT NULL)

-- Option 2:

SELECT EI.*
FROM [dbo].[Employee Info] EI
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[Employee position2] EP ON EI.EmpID = EP.EmpID
WHERE EP.DateOfJoining IS NOT NULL;
```

-- Q20: Write a query to retrieve two minimum and maximum salaries from the EmployeePosition table
```sql
SELECT Salary
FROM (SELECT TOP 2 Salary
    FROM [dbo].[Employee position2]
    ORDER BY Salary ASC) AS MinSalaries

UNION

SELECT Salary
FROM (SELECT TOP 2 Salary
    FROM [dbo].[Employee position2]
    ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS MaxSalaries;
```

## Findings

- **Employee Demographics**: The dataset captures employees with details such as names, DOB, gender, department, and address. Gender distribution can be analyzed and DOB ranges (Q11) show employees born between 1970–1995, allowing age-group segmentation.
- **Departmental Insights**: The analysis shows department-wise counts, highlighting HR and other departments’ workforce sizes. Sorting by department count reveals which departments are most/least staffed.
- **Position & Salary Analysis**: Managerial roles are identifiable, enabling leadership headcount reporting. Salary ranges (Q7, Q20) highlight employees earning between 50,000–100,000 as the min/max salary bands. Top earners can be extracted (Q9), useful for compensation benchmarking.
- **Employee Trends**: Employees with DateOfJoining not null (Q19) show active workforce.



## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be applied to database setup, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis using employee information. By working with the EmployeeInfo and EmployeePosition2 tables, we were able to:
- Standardize and clean data (removing nulls, formatting DOB, parsing addresses).
- Generate demographic insights such as gender distribution, age ranges, and departmental counts.
- Explore organizational structure by identifying managerial roles and department staffing levels.
- Analyze salary trends, including ranges, top earners, and employees within specific pay bands.
- Retrieve targeted employee details using conditions on names, addresses, and joining dates.

Overall, the exercise highlights how SQL queries can uncover meaningful workforce insights, support HR reporting, and provide a foundation for business-driven decision making.
